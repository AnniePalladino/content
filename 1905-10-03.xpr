                    <p>Trains run alongside the steamers on the quay, and passengers can be conveyed to
                        Famagusta, Nicosia, Morphou and intermediate stations. Good hotel accommodation
                        for tourists is provided at Famagusta, at the Savoy Hotel (Mr. Najem Houry
                        proprietor). Olympus Hotel, Mount Troodos, 6000 ft. above the sea. Magnificent
                        Scenery. Perfect climate. Season May to end of October. For information apply to
                        Mr. Najem Houry, Managing Director of Cyprus Hotel Co., Army Contractor,
                        Limassol, Cyprus. There is a good carriage road from Kopia (on Railway) to
                        Troodos. At Famagusta may be seen the fine old Latin Cathedral (now a mosque)
                        begun in 1300 and finished in 1312, together with other ancient ruins and the
                        Venetian fortifications, the finest in the world. Also the tower or palace, the
                        scene of “Othello'' and of Ford's “Lover's Melancholy.'' The climate of Cyprus
                        in the winter months is delightful and the Island will well repay a visit.</p>

But it is worth while noting that several French author ities on the Macedonian question have stated that the English enthusiasta spuld never have their relorms carried out unlew the British Ambasador were able to go before the Sultan Armed with strong friendship sodan challenged prestige Unfortunately it go be wid that British prestige at Constantinople

            <head>THE PRINCES AND THE DAIRA. LETTER PROM Lord CROMER.</head>
            <p>Our contemporary “Al Lewa” publishes an important letter from Lord Cromer to
                H.H. Prince Ibrahim Pasha Halim concerning the action to be brought by the
                Princes, sons of the late Khedive Ismail, against the Govern- ment claiming
                the restoration of the remaining surplus of the Daira Sanich after the
                satis- faction of all the creditors of the said admi- nistration, as being
                heirs of the former owner the late Khedive. One of the claimants, Prince
                Ibrahim Pasha Halim according to our con- temporary, wrote to ask Lord
                Cromer’s opinion on his claim. Lord Cromer's reply left no doubt as to his
                opinion ; he expressed his agree- ment with the view of the Coutentieux and
                after drawing the attention of Prince Ibrahim to the opinion he had given in
                1878 when serving on the Commission of tho Egyptian Debt, vix., that the
                Daira properties had been illegally acquired, that their acquisition was
                prejudicial to the interests of the country and that the Khedive should
                restore the properties illegally obtained, he added : — “ I still maintain
                my opinion and regret to inform your Highness that not only am I unable to
                support your claim but that should the Egyptian Government be disposed to
                admit it, I would be obliged to protest in the most effective fashion in the
                interests of the Egyptian people and taxpayers.”</p>
            <p>This excellent and uncompromising answer appears to have greatly annoyed our
                confrere, Mustapha Pasha Kamel, who calls upon the Egyptian public to show
                their resentment at the affront offered to the sons of the late Khedive
                Ismail and to support the demand of the princes for the restoration of their
                rights. We imagine that the Egyptian public will prefer Lord Cromer's advice
                to that of the "Nationalist leader” and Turkish pasha.</p>

                    was very largely attended. Mme Tonelli, sister of the well-known Alexandria
                    musician Professor Lombardo, also assisted, playing a duet with Mme Meyor
                    which was very much appreciated and in which both ladies showed great
                    musical talent. MM. Astorre and Michel Mabardi sang together in an excellent
                    manner, and M- Amodio greatly pleased the audience by his rendering of a
                    selection from the opera Aida which he played on the violin. M. Egon Mabardi
                    recited excel- lently. We must also mention Miles Lea Ponta, Eveline
                    Tonelli, Mario and Olga Philippides, all of whom performed their part of the

                    confec- tioner’s shop in the Sharia el Manskh in company with M. Laroux at
                    6.30 p.m. yester- day, suddenly staggered and fell. Medical aid was
                    unavailing, death, which is stated to have been caused by heart disease
                    having been instantaneous. The body of M. de la Bonglise was removed to the
                    French hospital from which the funeral will start at 4 p.m.</p>
                <p>The sad news caused considerable excite ment on tho Alexandria bourse this

                <head>THE PRINCES AND THE DAIRA. LETTER PROM Lord CROMER.</head>
                <p>Our contemporary “Al Lewa” publishes an important letter from Lord Cromer to
                    H.H. Prince Ibrahim Pasha Halim concerning the action to be brought by the
                    Princes, sons of the late Khedive Ismail, against the Govern- ment claiming
                    the restoration of the remaining surplus of the Daira Sanich after the
                    satis- faction of all the creditors of the said admi- nistration, as being
                    heirs of the former owner the late Khedive. One of the claimants, Prince
                    Ibrahim Pasha Halim according to our con- temporary, wrote to ask Lord
                    Cromer’s opinion on his claim. Lord Cromer's reply left no doubt as to his
                    opinion ; he expressed his agree- ment with the view of the Coutentieux and
                    after drawing the attention of Prince Ibrahim to the opinion he had given in
                    1878 when serving on the Commission of tho Egyptian Debt, vix., that the
                    Daira properties had been illegally acquired, that their acquisition was
                    prejudicial to the interests of the country and that the Khedive should
                    restore the properties illegally obtained, he added : — “ I still maintain
                    my opinion and regret to inform your Highness that not only am I unable to
                    support your claim but that should the Egyptian Government be disposed to
                    admit it, I would be obliged to protest in the most effective fashion in the
                    interests of the Egyptian people and taxpayers.”</p>
                <p>This excellent and uncompromising answer appears to have greatly annoyed our
                    confrere, Mustapha Pasha Kamel, who calls upon the Egyptian public to show
                    their resentment at the affront offered to the sons of the late Khedive
                    Ismail and to support the demand of the princes for the restoration of their
                    rights. We imagine that the Egyptian public will prefer Lord Cromer's advice
                    to that of the "Nationalist leader” and Turkish pasha.</p>

                <head>ASILE KAISER WILHELM.</head> 
                <p>A concert was given on Tuesday afternoon at the Asile Kaiser Wilheim under
                    the patronage of the vice-consul of Germany by Mme Meyer and her pupils and
                    was very largely attended. Mme Tonelli, sister of the well-known Alexandria
                    musician Professor Lombardo, also assisted, playing a duet with Mme Meyor
                    which was very much appreciated and in which both ladies showed great
                    musical talent. MM. Astorre and Michel Mabardi sang together in an excellent
                    manner, and M- Amodio greatly pleased the audience by his rendering of a
                    selection from the opera Aida which he played on the violin. M. Egon Mabardi
                    recited excel- lently. We must also mention Miles Lea Ponta, Eveline
                    Tonelli, Mario and Olga Philippides, all of whom performed their part of the
                    pro- gramme most faithfully and showed a wonderful technical knowledge of
                    music, although they are still quite children.</p>
